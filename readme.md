# Breadboard modular synth

![Current synth status](./images/IMG_3965.JPG)
Inspired by Moritz Klein I decided to take some of his lessons and other material and combine them to make a synth for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Primary goal of learning electronics in depth.<br/>

### Current status: working<br/>
### Current modules built: VCO, power supply, midi to CV, passive mixer.<br/>

The circuits look so cramped because I want them each to be the size of one breadboard section(Half a full breadboard).
